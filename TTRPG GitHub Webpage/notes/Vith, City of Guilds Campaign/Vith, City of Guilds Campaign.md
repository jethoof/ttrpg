# Vith, City of Guilds
Welcome to Vith, a port city located at the heart of the Sehin continent. The city is governed by three races, Dwarves, Elves and Humans. The city has many guilds that influence the political landscapes of Vith and its tensions and invisible skirmishes between the organizations keep the city bustling for new exciting opportunities. 

Many of the major guilds hire smaller guilds to do their work the public's eye doesn't want to see to gain more influence over the city's control.

You, along with some likely minded denizens of Sehin have formed a new guild, to seize this opportunity for your own fame,  fortune and power.

## History 

### A great war ended and the world is trying to readjust to the changes. 
The Vith was created to protect Dwarven, Elven and Human lands from the growing threat of a coalition of Goblins, Orcs and Kobolds called Coven of Beasts. The human city-state, formerly called Ford’s Landing, became the bastion for this alliance when Dwarven capital, Kufferkrone, was attacked by Kobolds leading to what they call it the Great War. Vith won against the Coven and drove the other humanoids north and underground and 150 years have passed since the day they took back Kufferkrone…

The city has seen many changes as it moved from council from each of the races to more guild oriented as some of the armies from each of the races started their own business shortly after the peace.
