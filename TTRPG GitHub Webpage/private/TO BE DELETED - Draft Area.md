## Draft Area
I use Obsidian for writing fiction for my tabletop RPG and journaling. I've moved most of my works from my Evernote and Onenote into here and started working on research for new ideas and means and I think my effectiveness has gone up significantly instead of relying on the notes and mostly my brain to recall them. 

My system isn't perfect mind you, I am constantly tweaking the system whenever I find a better way for my brain to access the information I just logged.

This little software lets you write down in a [markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) the beauty of this system is you can create a wiki like system for you on your computer for your own reference guide. If you enjoy going to Wikipedia and reading stuff there for hours and ever thought about creating your own for some reason, this could be it. 

As for person who jumps from one idea to the next, this somewhat helps me stay focused, most of the time, because I can create a new link and move on with my current writing and worry about that link later on. In fact, while I was writing the paragraph above I actually don't know much about markdown system, I simply make a link and looked it up on wiki and connected it.

The magic works when I am working on my writing or table top game scenarios where I can simply write whatever comes to my mind then later create links to expand more on the ideas arose while I was writing. 

This linking method means I don't have to sort them out in folder structures. they can be in anywhere as long as it's in the same vault folder. Yes they can be sorted out in a folder structure for number of other reasons, but you can link a file and refer it in many other files without making a duplication. 

Another tool this provides is the graph view. This feature lets you see the entire vault like a web of connected dots or just floating dots when they don't have any connections.

This is the monster I have and I am proud of it. The benefit I find is seeing my notes in a different perspective.

The way the information can be sorted and accessed various depending on how you organize them as well. I was adamant on using folders until 11 months in because it became somewhat unwieldy and I was using zettelkasten writing method with unique id creation with year-month-date-hour-minute as a file name and I was unable to sort them out by just looking at the file names in a graph view.

The point is there are many ways to sort your information and there's no one way of doing it. The popular method many of the community is using seems like the [Johnny Decimal System](https://johnnydecimal.com/) mixed with [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) to make atomic notes that you can search them. I use both plus tags, [aliases](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Aliases) and [Metadata](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Metadata) to sort them further. It's not perfect but it gets the job done. 

The benefit to this system is for me to pick things up where I left off from my last train of thoughts and able to extend and refine my ideas.

## What I think Obsidian is for:

This isn't for you to collect notes from places on the internet for you to read for another time and be done with it. It's not the most useful in that sense and there are better systems that can do that such as [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) or [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/en) or [Onenote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) which I have used all for my note taking experiences. 

Obsidian's greatest power lies in synthesis of new ideas through connecting information weave something new or split the ideas into smaller digestible bits to be used in other parts like a Lego piece.

I have not used their Sync or Publish feature to use it on my phone or share my crazy ideas on the web like some brave folks in the Obsidian community.

Here are the things I love about the Obsidian as a basic program
- Simple, stupid simple - It looks like a text editor at first glance, in an essence it is, and you can start writing whatever comes to your mine right away. It doesn't give me a room to make things pretty or anything , it lets me complete why I opened this app for - jot something down.
- Fast and Tiny - because it's so simple it doesn't eat up much space for hard drive nor ram.
- Links Links everywhere - I can write my idea and whenever I think I have to make a link within my own ideas, I can create them in an instant or if I think the topic within the note is getting to big to be its own and worth making its own, I can split them off into a new note. Or when you  think you have to expand on the idea, you can make a new link right there and just keep going.

As a base feature its core selling point is that but it can do more with addons from the community mods...

## The Community Mods:

The true potential unlocks when you start using the community addons and I am the last person to talk about the benefits of using them compared to all the other apps I have listed above. Some made their system like a daily planner with daily schedules, weather, to do lists and even their fitness tracker. From what I can gather from the community's showcase, Obsidian can do almost anything you think you think it can do. Except math calculations, but it can make math equations.
