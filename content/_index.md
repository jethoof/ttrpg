title: Jethoof's Sandbox
---

Hi I am Jethoof and I love running TTRPG, mainly Dungeons and Dragons 5e, and trying to use this place to share some of the things I do with my several game groups. One of the things I  share here is the 1shot proposals for my online group [Obsidian Markdown](https://obsidian.md/) .

[Here are the one shot proposals I have so far](https://jethoof.github.io/ttrpg/tags/DnD/)

In the future I want to post things about my experience in running a game.

Also testing whether this would work in linking files [[notes/Vith, City of Guilds Campaign/Iron Hounds Reliquary|Iron Hounds Reliquary]]
