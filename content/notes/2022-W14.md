# Weekly Log: 2022-W14
## My Actions

## My Thoughts
So I learned that I have to actively create this for me to get the notes so um well ... that's not that useful  not sure whether I will use this thing at this point?  well let's try to have it and see if it is any better... 

Also looking at the stuff I've created in the last week and I sorta want to see the total  number of notes created in the past week month or year to track my progression.
