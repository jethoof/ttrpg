## Basic Setup

This is just to speed up the character creation process of things and I'm pretty flexible with whatever character you bring it to me as long as you have solid concept behind it. The Available Races and their rarity will affect how the denizens will see and treat you. 
### Homebrews: 
- **Being Smart Helps**: You gain additional Skill/Language/Tool proficiency equal to your Int Mod (Yes, this means negative will cause you to lost one!)
- **Heirloom**: You gain one mastercraft equipment that's been in your family passed down for generation(s).
- **Quirk**: At level 1, you have a bonus feat.

>Ringbay is the most northwestern port town among human settlements in Sehin and it was known for gold rush fifty years ago and still used as a base of operation for many gold prospectors heading up north to the marshlands up to Fort Salt Marsh. The area is also well known for its ongoing skirmish with the goblin tribes to the East and so far it has been in stalemate as neither side has the resources to cross the wild forest and marshlands to strike one another at full force.
