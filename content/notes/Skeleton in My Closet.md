# Skeletons in My Closet (SiMC)
This is inspired by [My friends and I have something called "Knife Theory"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/775caq/my_friends_and_i_have_something_called_knife/) and I wanted to provide something more concrete for my players going forward. 

Tabletop Role Playing Game offers a unique space for a group of people to come together to weave their own story. SiMC provide a consent between the player and the GM to be used in the campaign to enrich the storytelling experience. These are very generic and add more details to it to truly make it yours. GM can also ask further questions about the Player Character's backgrounds.

Keep in mind PC's backgrounds only offer who they were and the main focus should be what happens in the session and what will happen between the PCs and GM's narrative going forward. 

Don't get too caught up in the past, keep the past incomplete so the player and the GM can create them together.

## Inspiration Tables
If you are not sure what kind of skeletons to keep in your character's closet, hope these tables could inspire you.
