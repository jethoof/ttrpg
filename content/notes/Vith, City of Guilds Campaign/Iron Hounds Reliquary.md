# Welcome to Vith, the city of guilds
![[notes/ttrpg/OMG One Shot Campaign Selection and Outline]]

Vith is a coastal metropolis with a river running along the middle. Its iconic buildings from a far is a giant walled guild building and  a floating disembodied tower with unblinking red eye at the center of the city.

Vith is a thriving city state governed by twelve major guilds lead by Dwarves, Elves and Humans.

# An Ode for Four Heroes
A Bulwark with two shields,

A clergy with seven fingers,

A captain with a trident,

A Scout with no arrows,

Together they fought and rest here.
