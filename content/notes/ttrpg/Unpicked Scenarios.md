# Unpicked Scenarios

> [!summary] ##  Pie Delivery?
>**Theme**: Western Fantasy Point Crawl

> Ringbay is the most northwestern port town among human settlements in Sehin, known for gold and unforgiving wilderness, working as a base of operation for many gold prospectors heading up north to the marshlands  all the way up to Fort Salt Marsh. The only reason this place has yet turned into a thriving city is due to the wilderness that surrounds it. The creatures of these lands are feral and often times seen as much bigger than its docile counterparts in the southern areas. The area is also well known for its ongoing skirmish with the goblin tribes to the East. The only thing that' keeping the stalemate is the wilderness.

> You are hired by Domalin, a middle aged dwarf merchant you've worked with before, to escort his caravan from Ringbay to Kupferkrone, A dwarven city state in Jagged Mountains to the East by taking the road around the wilds through Berryglen, a halfling settlement known for pies. You have worked with this dwarf in the past, quirky but he pays well. This time he paid one third in advance to sweeten the deal and when you asked what's in the cargo, he simply replies, "Pies.". What could possibly go wrong?
