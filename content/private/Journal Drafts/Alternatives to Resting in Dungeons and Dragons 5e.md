Your party just fought against a horde of goblins and narrowly escaped death with sliver of health in a dungeon heading towards the heart of a dragon's lair.

You take a long rest, your near fatal wounds are now completely healed and ready to face the dragon with full force the next day.

It's something you hear often among the players as a joke or a mechanics to keep the party constantly moving forward, in a game sense. However it breaks the immersion for me to think the dungeon is a safe place for you to rest for 8 hours and the master of the dungeon or lair is going to let the intruder to set up a camp and rest. Of course you as the Dungeon Master can simply not let them rest because there are monster roaming in the dungeon/lair to interrupt their long rest and stopping them from taking that sweet sleep or there is a time limit before their mission fails forcing them to press on.

That solved the sleeping in the dungeon part but there's still another issue, the lack of down time. 

Then let's stretch some time.

In the Dungeon Master's Guide page 267 there is a Rest Variants section; epic heroic or gritty realism. The gritty realism alters the short rest to 8 hours and long rest to 7 days. This fundamentally changes the dynamics of the game completely in more ways than one. unfortunately the DMG does not describe how it exactly alters the resting mechanics, such as what is allowed to be done during the rest time. What would constitute a light activity versus heavy activity? Does this mean if you accidently walk for 1 hour would reset my long rest timer? does the rest timer reset if your character cast a ritual? do you must rest for 7 days?

The DMG talks about it's a good option to emphasize intrigue, politics and interactions among other NPCs. Unless you are doing dungeon crawl, in fact I think it is essential to have all those activities to make your game more immersive. Spending time to collect information to plan ahead about the adventure ahead takes time, they can't google to look things up or amazon to have their immovable rods delivered at their doorstep the next day. They need to hit the dusty tomes in the wizard's tower and procure materials to make the right tools for the adventure from the right crafter.  Here's an addon to this gritty realism variant rest system.
