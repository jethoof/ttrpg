I love creating characters for my table top roleplaying games (TTRPG) and there are many ways of creating characters from looking up artworks on the Internet to random creation from places like [donjon](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/random/#type=npc). 

I personally like to craft my non-player character (NPC) that are part of the plot with more care than a click of a button.
