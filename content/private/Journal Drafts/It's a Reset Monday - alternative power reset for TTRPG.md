# It's a Reset Monday - alternative power reset for TTRPG

If you ever played any MMOs, there's a server reset on a weekly basis so the server doesn't crash. it's the same thing, the long rest reset is on Monday. The session always starts on Monday, unless it is a continuation from the last session, and the session happens in a span of a week. If the session is to have the to go to a dungeon then it would make the party to be more careful on picking fights and they will be more tactical rather than fireball first and ask questions later. they know they cannot rely on a long rest to refresh their abilities and they know there's a big boss at the end and have to manage their resources more carefully.
