This time is domestic. Ba Sei the merchant, renown for his trades in perishable and questionable goods, is throwing a banquette and the Shadow Talon requests you to assassinate him and make it look like an accident and as usual, keep your public gaze averted from your operations. The organization suspects his wealth is ill earned and is conspiring with outside forces to oppose the King and such treachery should be nipped at the bud. Find out what is being conspired at the banquette and remove Ba Sei from the board.\n### Head Heist\nA strange letter slipped under your door the other day requesting your specific skills for a lucrative reward. When you showed up at a specified meeting location, a man with a bucket over his head introduces himself as Deshales and gave you a bracelet with moving constellations and a glass bauble with gears and cogs moving inside. He instructs the bracelet is a hall pass and the bauble is the time table. Then he instructs you to wear the bracelet and when the time table flickers in various colors, open a door with the worn hand to enter the House of Heads. He cautions you to not engage the person you meet in that place and find a head labeled as Baron Von Loid before the time table flickers again in 4 hours to return to this place. \n### Temple Raid\nThe Society of Historical and Archeological Relic Treasury (SHART) excavates ruins and collects relics of the past to inform the public about the rich history of their lands. Recently an island inhabited by kobolds and ruled by a giant named Kovachi reported a ruin unearthed after an earthquake. The initial reports say there are motifs of giants culture and signs of warning to not enter. The SHARTs sent an expedition and never returned. They are forming a second team and you are part of it to discover what happened to the first team and what lies beneath the ruins.

Once I get started I can't stop myself form talking for hours and hours. Also because of this I always had a small notebook in my pocket to write things down whenever an idea struck me. the challenge came when I tried to access them again. I have to flip through my notebooks to find things. I had a piece of paper that had my goal for one year and I carried it with me for whole year as a physical reminder of the things I have to do before the year was over. So how can I improve my methods and solve the information access problem?\n\nWelcome  to [Obsidian Markdown](https://obsidian.md/).\n\n## What I think Obsidian is for:\n\nThis isn't for you to collect notes from places on the internet for you to read for another time and be done with it. It's not the most useful in that sense and there are better systems that can do that such as [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) or [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/en) or [Onenote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) which I have used all for my note taking experiences. \n\nObsidian's greatest power lies in synthesis of new ideas through connecting information weave something new or split the ideas into smaller digestible bits to be used in other parts like a Lego piece.\n\nI have not used their Sync or Publish feature to use it on my phone or share my crazy ideas on the web like some brave folks in the Obsidian community.\n\nHere are the things I love about the Obsidian as a basic program\n- Simple, stupid simple - It looks like a text editor at first glance, in an essence it is, and you can start writing whatever comes to your mine right away. It doesn't give me a room to make things pretty or anything , it lets me complete why I opened this app for - jot something down.\n- Fast and Tiny - because it's so simple it doesn't eat up much space for hard drive nor ram.\n- Links Links everywhere - I can write my idea and whenever I think I have to make a link within my own ideas, I can create them in an instant or if I think the topic within the note is getting to big to be its own and worth making its own, I can split them off into a new note. Or when you  think you have to expand on the idea, you can make a new link right there and just keep going.\n\nAs a base feature its core selling point is that but it can do more with addons from the community mods...\n\n## The Community Mods:\n\nThe true potential unlocks when you start using the community addons and I am the last person to talk about the benefits of using them compared to all the other apps I have listed above. Some made their system like a daily planner with daily schedules, weather, to do lists and even their fitness tracker. From what I can gather from the community's showcase, Obsidian can do almost anything you think you think it can do. Except math calculations, but it can make math equations.\n\n## How I am using Obsidian\n\nI use Obsidian for writing fiction for my tabletop RPG and journaling. I've moved most of my works from my Evernote and Onenote into here and started working on research for new ideas and means and I think my effectiveness has gone up significantly instead of relying on the notes and mostly my brain to recall them. \n\nMy system isn't perfect mind you, I am constantly tweaking the system whenever I find a better way for my brain to access the information I just logged.\n\n\n## Draft Area\n\nThis little software lets you write down in a [markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) the beauty of this system is you can create a wiki like system for you on your computer for your own reference guide. If you enjoy going to Wikipedia and reading stuff there for hours and ever thought about creating your own for some reason, this could be it. \n\nAs for person who jumps from one idea to the next, this somewhat helps me stay focused, most of the time, because I can create a new link and move on with my current writing and worry about that link later on. In fact, while I was writing the paragraph above I actually don't know much about markdown system, I simply make a link and looked it up on wiki and connected it.\n\nThe magic works when I am working on my writing or table top game scenarios where I can simply write whatever comes to my mind then later create links to expand more on the ideas arose while I was writing. \n\nThis linking method means I don't have to sort them out in folder structures. they can be in anywhere as long as it's in the same vault folder. Yes they can be sorted out in a folder structure for number of other reasons, but you can link a file and refer it in many other files without making a duplication. \n\nAnother tool this provides is the graph view. This feature lets you see the entire vault like a web of connected dots or just floating dots when they don't have any connections. \n![[20230124190233 - Graph View 11mo.png]]\nThis is the monster I have and I am proud of it. The benefit I find is seeing my notes in a different perspective.\n\nThe way the information can be sorted and accessed various depending on how you organize them as well. I was adamant on using folders until 11 months in because it became somewhat unwieldy and I was using zettelkasten writing method with unique id creation with year-month-date-hour-minute as a file name and I was unable to sort them out by just looking at the file names in a graph view.\n\nThe point is there are many ways to sort your information and there's no one way of doing it. The popular method many of the community is using seems like the [Johnny Decimal System](https://johnnydecimal.com/) mixed with [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) to make atomic notes that you can search them. I use both plus tags, [aliases](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Aliases) and [Metadata](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Metadata) to sort them further. It's not perfect but it gets the job done. \n\nThe benefit to this system is for me to pick things up where I left off from my last train of thoughts and able to extend and refine my ideas.","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T05:45:33.035814882Z","tags":null},"/Skeleton-in-My-Closet":{"title":"Skeletons in My Closet","content":"\n# Skeletons in My Closet (SiMC)\nThis is inspired by [My friends and I have something called \"Knife Theory\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/775caq/my_friends_and_i_have_something_called_knife/) and I wanted to provide something more concrete for my players going forward. \n\nTabletop Role Playing Game offers a unique space for a group of people to come together to weave their own story.

The open room housed a headless giant slouched against room's wall tied up in chains with each of its limb anchored to a wall. Each of those links had runes of protection carved in dwarven with seals of reinforcement and protection in elven with withered vines wrapping around the chains. The headless body had its chest cavity hollowed and was emitting an eerie magenta lights wriggled like tendrils.\n\n\"A mummified headless corpse is all we find at the bottom of this pit?\" Amberdew raised his shield and tightened his grip.\n\n\"Why would our guildmaster hide such thing from the council and the members?\" Hymal gaped his mouth and kneeled on his knees in disbelief. Hymal was coerced here against his will and was bound to ensure he wouldn't hinder their expedition.\n\n\"Faeora, you still doubt my claims after seeing this? You've been deceived by your guild master and the council since its founding.\" Goldfield grabbed Hymal's collar and lifted him slightly from the ground, gazing at the headless remains.\n\n\"Look at the carvings on the wall, these are dwarven runes and the ancient elven arcane seals. It all makes sense.\" He added.\n\n\"None of these makes sense.\" Hymal replied.\n\n\"Open your eyes, Faeora. You can't just build this on a whim. This takes years of planning and vast number of craftsman and enchanters from dwarves and elves. Where are the craftsman who built them? keeping their silence or were they silenced?\" Hymal stared at Goldfield strolling around the room running his hand against the runes and jingled one of the chain binding the left arm.\n\n\"This must be something he found during the founding of the city and the guild, we might have been assigned to guard this thing from waking up...\" Hymal muttered.\n\n\"Just think. Erindal's known for his combat prowess, knowledge in history and arcane, and charismatic leadership. It's unnatural, almost divine. I'm sure he has you under his influence for decades, centuries even!\" He slowly advanced to the eerie glow, leaving Hymal with his own thoughts.\n\nErindal never hid his intention to his guild members and kept his promise to his best capacity to hymal's memory decades before the founding of the guild. When Erindal picked up his bow and go against the Airi's Council's wishes to aid dwarves of Kupferkrone, he followed. When Erindal invited Hymal to join him and a group of elves to found a guild after being exiled from Airi and Arendel, he followed. When Erindal ordered him to stay and tender the forest while the rest of the founding members heeded a call to save Kupferkrone once more, he followed.\n\nSo when Goldfield barged into his residence at night with dozens of his henchmen claiming there's a secret under his residence, he rejected Goldfield.\n\n\"Do you think a mere mortal could have such power and simply claim he is blessed by our god around his neck?\" Goldfield added and pointed at the glowing belly of the monster.\n\n\"That is his source of power, he knew about this before anyone else and had everyone fooled to get him here. Even you. I'm sure there are more from the city who is part of this, thing. Are you still that blind? You and I both saw the dwelling below your home, it was used frequently. Am I deceiving you or your guild master Faeora?\" Goldfield yelled at Hymal from the end of the room in front of the giant's torso. The echoes of Goldfield's voice rang in Hymal's ears as he lidded his eyes heavily.\n\n\"How did you learn about this and what is your goal now you've seen this?\" Hymal listlessly questioned and Goldfield walked back to him with a dagger and cut Hymal's binds.\n\n\"Join me and help me expose Erindal of his evil and uproot his presence from this city.\" he sheathed his dagger and extended his hand.\n\n\"You're not as just as you would claim yourself from what I hear.\" Hymal rubbed his wrist and glared at the gold haired elf.\n\n\"I won't claim I am justice incarnate. Trust me, it's all for the best.\"\n\n\"For who?\"\n\n\"The Elvenkind.\"\n\n\"Spare me your twisted humor. I know your relations to the disappearance of the Spring Circle, they were mostly elves.\"\n\n\"I wasn't aware you still cling to your old title of a druid. Instead, you should be thankful. I have liberated you from the insane burden of taking care of the world and beyond.\" Goldfield made a bitter grin with a light shrug and Hymal was unable to comprehend his statement other than avoiding the actual question.\n\n\"After the disappearance of the Spring Circle, Lunar Pears, your guild, quickly took over the groves and the meadows tended by the circle.\" Hymal continued to glare at the elf's blue eyes.\n\n\"We merely continued to tend the nature the Circle neglected.\"\n\n\"I heard you are in charge of those fields.\"\n\n\"Somebody has to be in charge of it.\"\n\n\"Are you going to take charge of this place once you remove our guild master?\"\n\n\"If the city demands it. My sole desire is to remove the evil in the place where I do my business.\" Goldfield looked over the group of his crew advanced toward the headless body.\n\n\"I have invested so much to get down here to find out what Erindal is hiding and I have never expected it to be something like this. Just look at it Faeora, this isn't just a giant. This must be a fabled remains of a deity, how else a remain like this emits such aura and hidden beneath the city by magic of elves and dwarves?\" Hymal scoffed at Goldfield's response but he started to question himself the question of the purpose of the place.\n\nHymal has heard of this from his father about the era when gods walked among mortals and waged war against each other. They can be as tall as twelve feet tall or as short as two feet, but during the war they were giants. They sundered the plains carved the mountains with their might and magic. Only a god or demigods can slay another and only if their heads are removed. It's just a legend.\n\n\"You are insane to accuse of my guild master using a dead god's remains as his source of power.\" Hymal shook his head, he couldnâ€™t shake off the feeling the thing was staring at him.\n\n\"I've seen close, and I believe it is possible.\" Goldfield raised his fist to where Hymal was staring at, where the giantâ€™s head should have been.\n\n\"You still haven't answered how you learned about this place.\" Hymal questioned Goldfield again.\n\n\"Years of investigation and no, don't give me that look. I seek no such power. If your guild is as corrupt as it is, then it's best to dismantle it. Most of your Council Elders seems to agree.\"\n\n\"Mister Goldfield, the glow seems to be a portal of some sort.\" one of the hirelings rushed to Goldfield to report.\n\n\"Well then we should enter and find out what is on the other side. I plan on getting to the bottom of all this to expose all of Erindal's dirty secrets.\"\n\n\"I believe the Ratcatchers require further compensation if we are to delve deeper.\" A half-elf female joined the conversation in a leather harness bearing various pockets.\n\n\"Yes, miss Feldon of Ratcatchers, this far exceeds my expectation and the effort you and your members have contributed thus far will be handsomely rewarded once we leave this hole. I will double the payment.\" Goldfield raised his two fingers in response.\n\n\"Triple.\" she replied and placed her hand on her sword's hilt. Goldfield's cold stare glanced over where her hand rested and let out a frustrated sigh.\n\n\"If we fight here and now, it's a loss on both sides miss Feldon. double and half. Final.\" Goldfield waved his hand and Feldon noticed Amberdew angled his shield to show her his sword already half drawn. The Ratcatchers initially entered this place with three teams of six and now they're down to seven while Goldfield's group only lost one and from the way she looked at it, he's recruiting the captive.\n\n\"double and half.\" she spat on the ground and walked away.\n\n\"Faeora, join me and let's find out what lies in that carcass your guildmaster chained up so dearly. I'm not asking you to work under me, let's see what lies ahead.\" Goldfield gestured Amberdew with a nod and Amberdew offered Hymal a spear.\n\n\"At least find out the truth in this place with me, for now.\" Goldfield added.\n\n\"For now.\" Hymal snatched the spear from Amberdew and looked over the rest of the crew setting up an encampment.\n\n\"Good, after some rest and we will venture forth, we still have a long journey ahead of us.\" Goldfield added, returning his gaze to the mummified remains.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T05:45:33.035814882Z","tags":null},"/notes/Howling-in-the-Night":{"title":"","content":"test","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T05:45:33.035814882Z","tags":null},"/notes/Pie-Delivery":{"title":"Pie Delivery","content":"\n## NPCs\nDomalin\nHigs\nThimble","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T05:45:33.035814882Z","tags":null},"/notes/Unpicked-Scenarios":{"title":"Unpicked Scenarios","content":"%% From [[OMG One Shot Campaign Selection and Outline]]%%\n# Unpicked Scenarios\n\n\u003e [!summary] 3.

As you get closer to the metropolis, the city is distinctively separated in five districts by the style of the buildings; flat and stony Dwarven district, tall and mosaic Human district, park like Elven district, brass and steaming New District and the walled Guild District.\n\nVith is a thriving city state governed by twelve major guilds lead by Dwarves, Elves and Humans. The city is the continent's first metropolis focusing on economic drive and allow various races to form a guild for prosperity. Despite the ideal premise, each of the major twelve guilds hire smaller guilds to do their dirty business ranging from espionage, sabotage and murder to further their agenda.\n\nRatcatchers are a relatively new guild housed in the New District taking jobs from various lines of high paying dirty jobs others shy away from. \n\nTrapper's Name: [[Trapper Opossum]]\n\nThe Reliquary\nIron Hounds are the top security guild in the city, known for their black armor with red hound emblem on their shields. Brutally efficient and solid organization. They are armed to teeth and always patrols in groups. They are the descendants of war veterans of the last Great War and as far as everyone in Vith knows, only the fool cross their blade against them.\n\nBut we are ratcatchers, we do what others won't. At least as long as they don't know it's us. \n\nDwarves are known to not donate their deceased to the Grim Harvest, an agricultural guild using undead as labor, and the Iron Hounds keep theirs in their own reliquary.

But what are they but just another greedy dwarves? once I did a little sniffing around, there's quite a security, I think we have something here my fellow Catchers. They have two guards on a 4 hour rotation and a designated candle keeper basically lives in the tomb. They do take in visitors, I've only seen dwarves no less, but I couldn't observe any further as a human scurrying around the dwarven district sticks out like a rat in a granary.\n\nOur client has given us a rough detail of what is to be expected; guards, traps and a safe to crack.

Be careful of their tiled floor tiles and weird holes on the wall. Or maybe they have something to prevent the Candle Keeper to not trigger any of them.\n\nOur client never mentioned about not stealing anything else so whatever you grab from that place is yours, make sure to swipe some extra for me.\n\nThey're lean and mean thugs my fellow Ratcatchers and going against them with your fangs out is a suicide. They're not, fortune smiles upon us, the brightest dwarves in the city. You should be able to outsmart them the Ratcatcher; hoodwink and disappear. So if you need anything, you can always ask our quartermaster for the tools you would need to get this done.\n\n---\n## Available items:\n\n| Name              | Cost (GP) | Weight (lb) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ----------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Alchemist Fire    | 50        | 0.1         | This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air.

Vith won against the Coven and drove the other humanoids north and underground and 150 years have passed since the day they took back Kufferkroneâ€¦\n\nThe city has seen many changes as it moved from council from each of the races to more guild oriented as some of the armies from each of the races started their own business shortly after the peace.\n\n  \n\n## Game Setup\n**Fantasy Setting**: High Magic Low Powered Pre-colonial Era\n**Level Range**: 3 - 8\n**Recommended Number of Players**: 3 to 5.\n**Level Progression Method**: Milestone based.\n\n\n---\n[[../../../../../30 Worldbuilding/30.10 Xinsei/30.13 Locations/Vith, City of Guilds|Vith]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T05:45:33.035814882Z","tags":null},"/notes/journal/Test-Journal-Entry":{"title":"Test Journal Entry","content":"\nI haven't touched this in a while so I am going to test how this would work with whether [[Howling in the Night]] with [[OMG One Shot Campaign Selection and Outline|OMG 1Shot]] links are working.","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T05:45:33.039814966Z","tags":null},"/ttrpg/OMG-One-Shot-Campaign-Selection-and-Outline":{"title":"OMG One Shot - Iron Hounds Reliquary Heist","content":"\n**Date**: 1:30 pm PST, Saturday, September 24, 2022 \u003cbr\u003e\n**Session Length**: Approx. 3.5 hours\n\n\u003e [!example] Character Creation\n\u003e - **Level**: 3\n\u003e - **Stat Arrangement**: Standard Array (15 14 13 12 10 8)\n\u003e - **Hit Points**: Average\n\u003e - **Wealth**: 300gp in addition to starting equipment from class and backgrounds with item availability set to commons only.\n\u003e - **Available Races**: Varies per scenario, no flying races (Owlin and Aarakocra) and warforged.\n\u003e - **Available Books**: Up to Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, no UA.\n\u003e - **Being Smart Helps**: You gain additional Skill/Language/Tool proficiency equal to your Int Mod (Yes, this means negative will cause you to lose some!)\n\u003e - **Heirloom**: You gain one mastercraft (non-magical +1 item) equipment that's been in your family passed down for generation(s).\n\u003e - **Quirk**: At level 1, you have a bonus feat. \n\nThis is just to speed up the character creation process of things and I'm pretty flexible with whatever character you bring it to me as long as you have solid concept behind it.
