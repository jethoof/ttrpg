This time is domestic. Ba Sei the merchant, renown for his trades in perishable and questionable goods, is throwing a banquette and the Shadow Talon requests you to assassinate him and make it look like an accident and as usual, keep your public gaze averted from your operations. The organization suspects his wealth is ill earned and is conspiring with outside forces to oppose the King and such treachery should be nipped at the bud. Find out what is being conspired at the banquette and remove Ba Sei from the board.\n### Head Heist\nA strange letter slipped under your door the other day requesting your specific skills for a lucrative reward. When you showed up at a specified meeting location, a man with a bucket over his head introduces himself as Deshales and gave you a bracelet with moving constellations and a glass bauble with gears and cogs moving inside. He instructs the bracelet is a hall pass and the bauble is the time table. Then he instructs you to wear the bracelet and when the time table flickers in various colors, open a door with the worn hand to enter the House of Heads. He cautions you to not engage the person you meet in that place and find a head labeled as Baron Von Loid before the time table flickers again in 4 hours to return to this place. \n### Temple Raid\nThe Society of Historical and Archeological Relic Treasury (SHART) excavates ruins and collects relics of the past to inform the public about the rich history of their lands. Recently an island inhabited by kobolds and ruled by a giant named Kovachi reported a ruin unearthed after an earthquake. The initial reports say there are motifs of giants culture and signs of warning to not enter. The SHARTs sent an expedition and never returned. They are forming a second team and you are part of it to discover what happened to the first team and what lies beneath the ruins.

Once I get started I can't stop myself form talking for hours and hours. Also because of this I always had a small notebook in my pocket to write things down whenever an idea struck me. the challenge came when I tried to access them again. I have to flip through my notebooks to find things. I had a piece of paper that had my goal for one year and I carried it with me for whole year as a physical reminder of the things I have to do before the year was over. So how can I improve my methods and solve the information access problem?\n\nWelcome  to [Obsidian Markdown](https://obsidian.md/).\n\n## What I think Obsidian is for:\n\nThis isn't for you to collect notes from places on the internet for you to read for another time and be done with it. It's not the most useful in that sense and there are better systems that can do that such as [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) or [Evernote](https://evernote.com/intl/en) or [Onenote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) which I have used all for my note taking experiences. \n\nObsidian's greatest power lies in synthesis of new ideas through connecting information weave something new or split the ideas into smaller digestible bits to be used in other parts like a Lego piece.\n\nI have not used their Sync or Publish feature to use it on my phone or share my crazy ideas on the web like some brave folks in the Obsidian community.\n\nHere are the things I love about the Obsidian as a basic program\n- Simple, stupid simple - It looks like a text editor at first glance, in an essence it is, and you can start writing whatever comes to your mine right away. It doesn't give me a room to make things pretty or anything , it lets me complete why I opened this app for - jot something down.\n- Fast and Tiny - because it's so simple it doesn't eat up much space for hard drive nor ram.\n- Links Links everywhere - I can write my idea and whenever I think I have to make a link within my own ideas, I can create them in an instant or if I think the topic within the note is getting to big to be its own and worth making its own, I can split them off into a new note. Or when you  think you have to expand on the idea, you can make a new link right there and just keep going.\n\nAs a base feature its core selling point is that but it can do more with addons from the community mods...\n\n## The Community Mods:\n\nThe true potential unlocks when you start using the community addons and I am the last person to talk about the benefits of using them compared to all the other apps I have listed above. Some made their system like a daily planner with daily schedules, weather, to do lists and even their fitness tracker. From what I can gather from the community's showcase, Obsidian can do almost anything you think you think it can do. Except math calculations, but it can make math equations.\n\n## How I am using Obsidian\n\nI use Obsidian for writing fiction for my tabletop RPG and journaling. I've moved most of my works from my Evernote and Onenote into here and started working on research for new ideas and means and I think my effectiveness has gone up significantly instead of relying on the notes and mostly my brain to recall them. \n\nMy system isn't perfect mind you, I am constantly tweaking the system whenever I find a better way for my brain to access the information I just logged.\n\n\n## Draft Area\n\nThis little software lets you write down in a [markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) the beauty of this system is you can create a wiki like system for you on your computer for your own reference guide. If you enjoy going to Wikipedia and reading stuff there for hours and ever thought about creating your own for some reason, this could be it. \n\nAs for person who jumps from one idea to the next, this somewhat helps me stay focused, most of the time, because I can create a new link and move on with my current writing and worry about that link later on. In fact, while I was writing the paragraph above I actually don't know much about markdown system, I simply make a link and looked it up on wiki and connected it.\n\nThe magic works when I am working on my writing or table top game scenarios where I can simply write whatever comes to my mind then later create links to expand more on the ideas arose while I was writing. \n\nThis linking method means I don't have to sort them out in folder structures. they can be in anywhere as long as it's in the same vault folder. Yes they can be sorted out in a folder structure for number of other reasons, but you can link a file and refer it in many other files without making a duplication. \n\nAnother tool this provides is the graph view. This feature lets you see the entire vault like a web of connected dots or just floating dots when they don't have any connections. \n![[20230124190233 - Graph View 11mo.png]]\nThis is the monster I have and I am proud of it. The benefit I find is seeing my notes in a different perspective.\n\nThe way the information can be sorted and accessed various depending on how you organize them as well. I was adamant on using folders until 11 months in because it became somewhat unwieldy and I was using zettelkasten writing method with unique id creation with year-month-date-hour-minute as a file name and I was unable to sort them out by just looking at the file names in a graph view.\n\nThe point is there are many ways to sort your information and there's no one way of doing it. The popular method many of the community is using seems like the [Johnny Decimal System](https://johnnydecimal.com/) mixed with [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) to make atomic notes that you can search them. I use both plus tags, [aliases](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Aliases) and [Metadata](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Metadata) to sort them further. It's not perfect but it gets the job done. \n\nThe benefit to this system is for me to pick things up where I left off from my last train of thoughts and able to extend and refine my ideas.","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T11:44:21.453783375Z","tags":null},"/Skeleton-in-My-Closet":{"title":"Skeletons in My Closet","content":"\n# Skeletons in My Closet (SiMC)\nThis is inspired by [My friends and I have something called \"Knife Theory\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/775caq/my_friends_and_i_have_something_called_knife/) and I wanted to provide something more concrete for my players going forward. \n\nTabletop Role Playing Game offers a unique space for a group of people to come together to weave their own story.

The open room housed a headless giant slouched against room's wall tied up in chains with each of its limb anchored to a wall. Each of those links had runes of protection carved in dwarven with seals of reinforcement and protection in elven with withered vines wrapping around the chains. The headless body had its chest cavity hollowed and was emitting an eerie magenta lights wriggled like tendrils.\n\n\"A mummified headless corpse is all we find at the bottom of this pit?\" Amberdew raised his shield and tightened his grip.\n\n\"Why would our guildmaster hide such thing from the council and the members?\" Hymal gaped his mouth and kneeled on his knees in disbelief. Hymal was coerced here against his will and was bound to ensure he wouldn't hinder their expedition.\n\n\"Faeora, you still doubt my claims after seeing this? You've been deceived by your guild master and the council since its founding.\" Goldfield grabbed Hymal's collar and lifted him slightly from the ground, gazing at the headless remains.\n\n\"Look at the carvings on the wall, these are dwarven runes and the ancient elven arcane seals. It all makes sense.\" He added.\n\n\"None of these makes sense.\" Hymal replied.\n\n\"Open your eyes, Faeora. You can't just build this on a whim. This takes years of planning and vast number of craftsman and enchanters from dwarves and elves. Where are the craftsman who built them? keeping their silence or were they silenced?\" Hymal stared at Goldfield strolling around the room running his hand against the runes and jingled one of the chain binding the left arm.\n\n\"This must be something he found during the founding of the city and the guild, we might have been assigned to guard this thing from waking up...\" Hymal muttered.\n\n\"Just think. Erindal's known for his combat prowess, knowledge in history and arcane, and charismatic leadership. It's unnatural, almost divine. I'm sure he has you under his influence for decades, centuries even!\" He slowly advanced to the eerie glow, leaving Hymal with his own thoughts.\n\nErindal never hid his intention to his guild members and kept his promise to his best capacity to hymal's memory decades before the founding of the guild. When Erindal picked up his bow and go against the Airi's Council's wishes to aid dwarves of Kupferkrone, he followed. When Erindal invited Hymal to join him and a group of elves to found a guild after being exiled from Airi and Arendel, he followed. When Erindal ordered him to stay and tender the forest while the rest of the founding members heeded a call to save Kupferkrone once more, he followed.\n\nSo when Goldfield barged into his residence at night with dozens of his henchmen claiming there's a secret under his residence, he rejected Goldfield.\n\n\"Do you think a mere mortal could have such power and simply claim he is blessed by our god around his neck?\" Goldfield added and pointed at the glowing belly of the monster.\n\n\"That is his source of power, he knew about this before anyone else and had everyone fooled to get him here. Even you. I'm sure there are more from the city who is part of this, thing. Are you still that blind? You and I both saw the dwelling below your home, it was used frequently. Am I deceiving you or your guild master Faeora?\" Goldfield yelled at Hymal from the end of the room in front of the giant's torso. The echoes of Goldfield's voice rang in Hymal's ears as he lidded his eyes heavily.\n\n\"How did you learn about this and what is your goal now you've seen this?\" Hymal listlessly questioned and Goldfield walked back to him with a dagger and cut Hymal's binds.\n\n\"Join me and help me expose Erindal of his evil and uproot his presence from this city.\" he sheathed his dagger and extended his hand.\n\n\"You're not as just as you would claim yourself from what I hear.\" Hymal rubbed his wrist and glared at the gold haired elf.\n\n\"I won't claim I am justice incarnate. Trust me, it's all for the best.\"\n\n\"For who?\"\n\n\"The Elvenkind.\"\n\n\"Spare me your twisted humor. I know your relations to the disappearance of the Spring Circle, they were mostly elves.\"\n\n\"I wasn't aware you still cling to your old title of a druid. Instead, you should be thankful. I have liberated you from the insane burden of taking care of the world and beyond.\" Goldfield made a bitter grin with a light shrug and Hymal was unable to comprehend his statement other than avoiding the actual question.\n\n\"After the disappearance of the Spring Circle, Lunar Pears, your guild, quickly took over the groves and the meadows tended by the circle.\" Hymal continued to glare at the elf's blue eyes.\n\n\"We merely continued to tend the nature the Circle neglected.\"\n\n\"I heard you are in charge of those fields.\"\n\n\"Somebody has to be in charge of it.\"\n\n\"Are you going to take charge of this place once you remove our guild master?\"\n\n\"If the city demands it. My sole desire is to remove the evil in the place where I do my business.\" Goldfield looked over the group of his crew advanced toward the headless body.\n\n\"I have invested so much to get down here to find out what Erindal is hiding and I have never expected it to be something like this. Just look at it Faeora, this isn't just a giant. This must be a fabled remains of a deity, how else a remain like this emits such aura and hidden beneath the city by magic of elves and dwarves?\" Hymal scoffed at Goldfield's response but he started to question himself the question of the purpose of the place.\n\nHymal has heard of this from his father about the era when gods walked among mortals and waged war against each other. They can be as tall as twelve feet tall or as short as two feet, but during the war they were giants. They sundered the plains carved the mountains with their might and magic. Only a god or demigods can slay another and only if their heads are removed. It's just a legend.\n\n\"You are insane to accuse of my guild master using a dead god's remains as his source of power.\" Hymal shook his head, he couldn’t shake off the feeling the thing was staring at him.\n\n\"I've seen close, and I believe it is possible.\" Goldfield raised his fist to where Hymal was staring at, where the giant’s head should have been.\n\n\"You still haven't answered how you learned about this place.\" Hymal questioned Goldfield again.\n\n\"Years of investigation and no, don't give me that look. I seek no such power. If your guild is as corrupt as it is, then it's best to dismantle it. Most of your Council Elders seems to agree.\"\n\n\"Mister Goldfield, the glow seems to be a portal of some sort.\" one of the hirelings rushed to Goldfield to report.\n\n\"Well then we should enter and find out what is on the other side. I plan on getting to the bottom of all this to expose all of Erindal's dirty secrets.\"\n\n\"I believe the Ratcatchers require further compensation if we are to delve deeper.\" A half-elf female joined the conversation in a leather harness bearing various pockets.\n\n\"Yes, miss Feldon of Ratcatchers, this far exceeds my expectation and the effort you and your members have contributed thus far will be handsomely rewarded once we leave this hole. I will double the payment.\" Goldfield raised his two fingers in response.\n\n\"Triple.\" she replied and placed her hand on her sword's hilt. Goldfield's cold stare glanced over where her hand rested and let out a frustrated sigh.\n\n\"If we fight here and now, it's a loss on both sides miss Feldon. double and half. Final.\" Goldfield waved his hand and Feldon noticed Amberdew angled his shield to show her his sword already half drawn. The Ratcatchers initially entered this place with three teams of six and now they're down to seven while Goldfield's group only lost one and from the way she looked at it, he's recruiting the captive.\n\n\"double and half.\" she spat on the ground and walked away.\n\n\"Faeora, join me and let's find out what lies in that carcass your guildmaster chained up so dearly. I'm not asking you to work under me, let's see what lies ahead.\" Goldfield gestured Amberdew with a nod and Amberdew offered Hymal a spear.\n\n\"At least find out the truth in this place with me, for now.\" Goldfield added.\n\n\"For now.\" Hymal snatched the spear from Amberdew and looked over the rest of the crew setting up an encampment.\n\n\"Good, after some rest and we will venture forth, we still have a long journey ahead of us.\" Goldfield added, returning his gaze to the mummified remains.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T11:44:21.453783375Z","tags":null},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

Its iconic buildings from a far is a giant walled guild building and  a floating disembodied tower with unblinking red eye at the center of the city. As you get closer to the metropolis, the city is distinctively separated in five districts by the style of the buildings; flat and stony Dwarven district, tall and mosaic Human district, park like Elven district, brass and steaming New District and the walled Guild District.\n\nVith is a thriving city state governed by twelve major guilds lead by Dwarves, Elves and Humans. The city is the continent's first metropolis focusing on economic drive and allow various races to form a guild for prosperity. Despite the ideal premise, each of the major twelve guilds hire smaller guilds to do their dirty business ranging from espionage, sabotage and murder to further their agenda.\n\nRatcatchers are a relatively new guild housed in the New District taking jobs from various lines of high paying dirty jobs others shy away from. \n\nTrapper's Name: [[Trapper Opossum]]\n\nThe Reliquary\nIron Hounds are the top security guild in the city, known for their black armor with red hound emblem on their shields. Brutally efficient and solid organization. They are armed to teeth and always patrols in groups. They are the descendants of war veterans of the last Great War and as far as everyone in Vith knows, only the fool cross their blade against them.\n\nBut we are ratcatchers, we do what others won't. At least as long as they don't know it's us. \n\nDwarves are known to not donate their deceased to the Grim Harvest, an agricultural guild using undead as labor, and the Iron Hounds keep theirs in their own reliquary.

They do take in visitors, I've only seen dwarves no less, but I couldn't observe any further as a human scurrying around the dwarven district sticks out like a rat in a granary.\n\nOur client has given us a rough detail of what is to be expected; guards, traps and a safe to crack.

Be careful of their tiled floor tiles and weird holes on the wall. Or maybe they have something to prevent the Candle Keeper to not trigger any of them.\n\nOur client never mentioned about not stealing anything else so whatever you grab from that place is yours, make sure to swipe some extra for me.\n\nThey're lean and mean thugs my fellow Ratcatchers and going against them with your fangs out is a suicide. They're not, fortune smiles upon us, the brightest dwarves in the city. You should be able to outsmart them the Ratcatcher; hoodwink and disappear.

The human city-state, formerly called Ford’s Landing, became the bastion for this alliance when Dwarven capital, Kufferkrone, was attacked by Kobolds leading to what they call it the Great War. Vith won against the Coven and drove the other humanoids north and underground and 150 years have passed since the day they took back Kufferkrone…\n\nThe city has seen many changes as it moved from council from each of the races to more guild oriented as some of the armies from each of the races started their own business shortly after the peace.\n\n  \n\n## Game Setup\n**Fantasy Setting**: High Magic Low Powered Pre-colonial Era\n**Level Range**: 3 - 8\n**Recommended Number of Players**: 3 to 5.\n**Level Progression Method**: Milestone based.\n\n\n---\n[[../../../../../30 Worldbuilding/30.10 Xinsei/30.13 Locations/Vith, City of Guilds|Vith]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T11:44:21.457783375Z","tags":null},"/notes/callouts":{"title":"Callouts","content":"\n## Callout support\n\nQuartz supports the same Admonition-callout syntax as Obsidian.\n\nThis includes\n- 12 Distinct callout types (each with several aliases)\n- Collapsable callouts\n\nSee [documentation on supported types and syntax here](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts#Types).\n\n## Showcase\n\n\u003e [!EXAMPLE] Examples\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: example\n\n\u003e [!note] Notes\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: note\n\n\u003e [!abstract] Summaries \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: abstract, summary, tldr\n\n\u003e [!info] Info \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: info, todo\n\n\u003e [!tip] Hint \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: tip, hint, important\n\n\u003e [!success] Success \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: success, check, done\n\n\u003e [!question] Question \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: question, help, faq\n\n\u003e [!warning] Warning \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: warning, caution, attention\n\n\u003e [!failure] Failure \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: failure, fail, missing\n\n\u003e [!danger] Error\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: danger, error\n\n\u003e [!bug] Bug\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: bug\n\n\u003e [!quote] Quote\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: quote, cite\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T11:44:21.457783375Z","tags":null},"/notes/config":{"title":"Configuration","content":"\n## Configuration\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-12T11:44:21.457783375Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e 🔗 Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first.

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!
