The open room housed a headless giant slouched against room's wall tied up in chains with each of its limb anchored to a wall. Each of those links had runes of protection carved in dwarven with seals of reinforcement and protection in elven with withered vines wrapping around the chains. The headless body had its chest cavity hollowed and was emitting an eerie magenta lights wriggled like tendrils.\n\n\"A mummified headless corpse is all we find at the bottom of this pit?\" Amberdew raised his shield and tightened his grip.\n\n\"Why would our guildmaster hide such thing from the council and the members?\" Hymal gaped his mouth and kneeled on his knees in disbelief. Hymal was coerced here against his will and was bound to ensure he wouldn't hinder their expedition.\n\n\"Faeora, you still doubt my claims after seeing this? You've been deceived by your guild master and the council since its founding.\" Goldfield grabbed Hymal's collar and lifted him slightly from the ground, gazing at the headless remains.\n\n\"Look at the carvings on the wall, these are dwarven runes and the ancient elven arcane seals. It all makes sense.\" He added.\n\n\"None of these makes sense.\" Hymal replied.\n\n\"Open your eyes, Faeora. You can't just build this on a whim. This takes years of planning and vast number of craftsman and enchanters from dwarves and elves. Where are the craftsman who built them? keeping their silence or were they silenced?\" Hymal stared at Goldfield strolling around the room running his hand against the runes and jingled one of the chain binding the left arm.\n\n\"This must be something he found during the founding of the city and the guild, we might have been assigned to guard this thing from waking up...\" Hymal muttered.\n\n\"Just think. Erindal's known for his combat prowess, knowledge in history and arcane, and charismatic leadership. It's unnatural, almost divine. I'm sure he has you under his influence for decades, centuries even!\" He slowly advanced to the eerie glow, leaving Hymal with his own thoughts.\n\nErindal never hid his intention to his guild members and kept his promise to his best capacity to hymal's memory decades before the founding of the guild. When Erindal picked up his bow and go against the Airi's Council's wishes to aid dwarves of Kupferkrone, he followed. When Erindal invited Hymal to join him and a group of elves to found a guild after being exiled from Airi and Arendel, he followed. When Erindal ordered him to stay and tender the forest while the rest of the founding members heeded a call to save Kupferkrone once more, he followed.\n\nSo when Goldfield barged into his residence at night with dozens of his henchmen claiming there's a secret under his residence, he rejected Goldfield.\n\n\"Do you think a mere mortal could have such power and simply claim he is blessed by our god around his neck?\" Goldfield added and pointed at the glowing belly of the monster.\n\n\"That is his source of power, he knew about this before anyone else and had everyone fooled to get him here. Even you. I'm sure there are more from the city who is part of this, thing. Are you still that blind? You and I both saw the dwelling below your home, it was used frequently. Am I deceiving you or your guild master Faeora?\" Goldfield yelled at Hymal from the end of the room in front of the giant's torso. The echoes of Goldfield's voice rang in Hymal's ears as he lidded his eyes heavily.\n\n\"How did you learn about this and what is your goal now you've seen this?\" Hymal listlessly questioned and Goldfield walked back to him with a dagger and cut Hymal's binds.\n\n\"Join me and help me expose Erindal of his evil and uproot his presence from this city.\" he sheathed his dagger and extended his hand.\n\n\"You're not as just as you would claim yourself from what I hear.\" Hymal rubbed his wrist and glared at the gold haired elf.\n\n\"I won't claim I am justice incarnate. Trust me, it's all for the best.\"\n\n\"For who?\"\n\n\"The Elvenkind.\"\n\n\"Spare me your twisted humor. I know your relations to the disappearance of the Spring Circle, they were mostly elves.\"\n\n\"I wasn't aware you still cling to your old title of a druid. Instead, you should be thankful. I have liberated you from the insane burden of taking care of the world and beyond.\" Goldfield made a bitter grin with a light shrug and Hymal was unable to comprehend his statement other than avoiding the actual question.\n\n\"After the disappearance of the Spring Circle, Lunar Pears, your guild, quickly took over the groves and the meadows tended by the circle.\" Hymal continued to glare at the elf's blue eyes.\n\n\"We merely continued to tend the nature the Circle neglected.\"\n\n\"I heard you are in charge of those fields.\"\n\n\"Somebody has to be in charge of it.\"\n\n\"Are you going to take charge of this place once you remove our guild master?\"\n\n\"If the city demands it. My sole desire is to remove the evil in the place where I do my business.\" Goldfield looked over the group of his crew advanced toward the headless body.\n\n\"I have invested so much to get down here to find out what Erindal is hiding and I have never expected it to be something like this. Just look at it Faeora, this isn't just a giant. This must be a fabled remains of a deity, how else a remain like this emits such aura and hidden beneath the city by magic of elves and dwarves?\" Hymal scoffed at Goldfield's response but he started to question himself the question of the purpose of the place.\n\nHymal has heard of this from his father about the era when gods walked among mortals and waged war against each other. They can be as tall as twelve feet tall or as short as two feet, but during the war they were giants. They sundered the plains carved the mountains with their might and magic. Only a god or demigods can slay another and only if their heads are removed. It's just a legend.\n\n\"You are insane to accuse of my guild master using a dead god's remains as his source of power.\" Hymal shook his head, he couldn’t shake off the feeling the thing was staring at him.\n\n\"I've seen close, and I believe it is possible.\" Goldfield raised his fist to where Hymal was staring at, where the giant’s head should have been.\n\n\"You still haven't answered how you learned about this place.\" Hymal questioned Goldfield again.\n\n\"Years of investigation and no, don't give me that look. I seek no such power. If your guild is as corrupt as it is, then it's best to dismantle it. Most of your Council Elders seems to agree.\"\n\n\"Mister Goldfield, the glow seems to be a portal of some sort.\" one of the hirelings rushed to Goldfield to report.\n\n\"Well then we should enter and find out what is on the other side. I plan on getting to the bottom of all this to expose all of Erindal's dirty secrets.\"\n\n\"I believe the Ratcatchers require further compensation if we are to delve deeper.\" A half-elf female joined the conversation in a leather harness bearing various pockets.\n\n\"Yes, miss Feldon of Ratcatchers, this far exceeds my expectation and the effort you and your members have contributed thus far will be handsomely rewarded once we leave this hole. I will double the payment.\" Goldfield raised his two fingers in response.\n\n\"Triple.\" she replied and placed her hand on her sword's hilt. Goldfield's cold stare glanced over where her hand rested and let out a frustrated sigh.\n\n\"If we fight here and now, it's a loss on both sides miss Feldon. double and half. Final.\" Goldfield waved his hand and Feldon noticed Amberdew angled his shield to show her his sword already half drawn. The Ratcatchers initially entered this place with three teams of six and now they're down to seven while Goldfield's group only lost one and from the way she looked at it, he's recruiting the captive.\n\n\"double and half.\" she spat on the ground and walked away.\n\n\"Faeora, join me and let's find out what lies in that carcass your guildmaster chained up so dearly. I'm not asking you to work under me, let's see what lies ahead.\" Goldfield gestured Amberdew with a nod and Amberdew offered Hymal a spear.\n\n\"At least find out the truth in this place with me, for now.\" Goldfield added.\n\n\"For now.\" Hymal snatched the spear from Amberdew and looked over the rest of the crew setting up an encampment.\n\n\"Good, after some rest and we will venture forth, we still have a long journey ahead of us.\" Goldfield added, returning his gaze to the mummified remains.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-16T06:54:20.632112091Z","tags":null},"/notes/Vith-City-of-Guilds-Campaign/Iron-Hound-Reliquary-Poem":{"title":"An ode for four heroes","content":"\n# Iron Hound Reliquary Poem\nA Bulwark with two shields,\nA medic with seven fingers,\nA captain with a trident,\nA Scout with no arrows,\nCombined is where their final rest lies.","lastmodified":"2023-03-16T06:54:20.632112091Z","tags":null},"/notes/Vith-City-of-Guilds-Campaign/Iron-Hounds-Reliquary":{"title":"Iron Hounds Reliquary","content":"\n# Welcome to Vith, the city of guilds\n![[notes/ttrpg/OMG One Shot Campaign Selection and Outline]]\n\nVith is a coastal metropolis with a river running along the middle. Its iconic buildings from a far is a giant walled guild building and  a floating disembodied tower with unblinking red eye at the center of the city. As you get closer to the metropolis, the city is distinctively separated in five districts by the style of the buildings; flat and stony Dwarven district, tall and mosaic Human district, park like Elven district, brass and steaming New District and the walled Guild District.\n\nVith is a thriving city state governed by twelve major guilds lead by Dwarves, Elves and Humans. The city is the continent's first metropolis focusing on economic drive and allow various races to form a guild for prosperity. Despite the ideal premise, each of the major twelve guilds hire smaller guilds to do their dirty business ranging from espionage, sabotage and murder to further their agenda.\n\nRatcatchers are a relatively new guild housed in the New District taking jobs from various lines of high paying dirty jobs others shy away from. \n\nTrapper's Name: Trapper Opossum\n\nThe Reliquary\nIron Hounds are the top security guild in the city, known for their black armor with red hound emblem on their shields. Brutally efficient and solid organization. They are armed to teeth and always patrols in groups. They are the descendants of war veterans of the last Great War and as far as everyone in Vith knows, only the fool cross their blade against them.\n\nBut we are ratcatchers, we do what others won't. At least as long as they don't know it's us. \n\nDwarves are known to not donate their deceased to the Grim Harvest, an agricultural guild using undead as labor, and the Iron Hounds keep theirs in their own reliquary.

I wasn't expecting them to have that many guards. They doubled the security since the last time and I... we got you out... no hard feelings right? This time I have something easier. We're probably prying something off from the dead instead of the living. Our client wants to remain annoy... annoying... anonymus! My guess is they are one of the big twelve guilds else why they want to mess with the biggest security guild? \n\n[[notes/ttrpg/20220922164036|Members List]]\n\nLet's cut to the cheese, stuff our client want is four clear crystals in a strongbox 137 in Iron Hound's Reliquary. yup, those mean dwarven black bastards keep their dead kin in their own crypt. But what are they but just another greedy dwarves? once I did a little sniffing around, there's quite a security, I think we have something here my fellow Catchers. They have two guards on a 4 hour rotation and a designated candle keeper basically lives in the tomb. They do take in visitors, I've only seen dwarves no less, but I couldn't observe any further as a human scurrying around the dwarven district sticks out like a rat in a granary.\n\nOur client has given us a rough detail of what is to be expected; guards, traps and a safe to crack. Also this chest with some helpful tools. \n\n\u003e [!info]- Chest\n\u003e \n\u003e - A poem\n\u003e \n\u003e \tA Bulwark with two shields, \n\u003e \t\n\u003e \tA Cleric with seven fingers,\n\u003e \t\n\u003e \tA captain with a trident,\n\u003e \t\n\u003e \tAnd a Scout with no arrows,\n\u003e \t\n\u003e \tTogether, they've fought, laughed and laid here.\n\u003e \n\u003e \n\u003e - Vial of Acid, 4\n\u003e \n\u003e - A key with 137 written on it\n\nRemember this is a guarded tomb, so I bet there's something shiny down there and those crafty dwarves would have made machinations to prevent good folks like us. Be careful of their tiled floor tiles and weird holes on the wall. Or maybe they have something to prevent the Candle Keeper to not trigger any of them.\n\nOur client never mentioned about not stealing anything else so whatever you grab from that place is yours, make sure to swipe some extra for me.\n\nThey're lean and mean thugs my fellow Ratcatchers and going against them with your fangs out is a suicide. They're not, fortune smiles upon us, the brightest dwarves in the city. You should be able to outsmart them the Ratcatcher; hoodwink and disappear. So if you need anything, you can always ask our quartermaster for the tools you would need to get this done.\n\n---\n## Available items:\n\n| Name              | Cost (GP) | Weight (lb) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ----------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Alchemist Fire    | 50        | 0.1         | This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air.

The city is governed by three races, Dwarves, Elves and Humans. The city has many guilds that influence the political landscapes of Vith and its tensions and invisible skirmishes between the organizations keep the city bustling for new exciting opportunities. \n\nMany of the major guilds hire smaller guilds to do their work the public's eye doesn't want to see to gain more influence over the city's control.\n\nYou, along with some likely minded denizens of Sehin have formed a new guild, to seize this opportunity for your own fame,  fortune and power.\n\n## History \n\n### A great war ended and the world is trying to readjust to the changes. \nThe Vith was created to protect Dwarven, Elven and Human lands from the growing threat of a coalition of Goblins, Orcs and Kobolds called Coven of Beasts. The human city-state, formerly called Ford’s Landing, became the bastion for this alliance when Dwarven capital, Kufferkrone, was attacked by Kobolds leading to what they call it the Great War. Vith won against the Coven and drove the other humanoids north and underground and 150 years have passed since the day they took back Kufferkrone…\n\nThe city has seen many changes as it moved from council from each of the races to more guild oriented as some of the armies from each of the races started their own business shortly after the peace.\n\n  \n\n## Game Setup\n**Fantasy Setting**: High Magic Low Powered Pre-colonial Era\n**Level Range**: 3 - 8\n**Recommended Number of Players**: 3 to 5.\n**Level Progression Method**: Milestone based.\n\n\n---\n[[../../../../../30 Worldbuilding/30.10 Xinsei/30.13 Locations/Vith, City of Guilds|Vith]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-16T06:54:20.632112091Z","tags":null},"/notes/journal/202302072054":{"title":"How Do You Keep Your Thoughts Organized?","content":"# How Do You Keep Your Thoughts Organized?\n\nI'm the type of person who jumps from an idea to an idea in a single conversation. Once I get started I can't stop myself form talking for hours and hours. Because of this, I always had a small notebook in my pocket to write things down whenever an idea struck me. The challenge came when I tried to access them at later time. I have to flip through my notebooks and decipher my chicken scratch to recall what was on my mind. So how can I improve my methods and solve the information access problem other than learning how to write prettier?\n\nWelcome  to [Obsidian Markdown](https://obsidian.md/).\n\n## Why I am Writing this\n\nThere are many things you can do on Obsidian and my choice of projects are Journaling, Creative Writing and Table Top Role Playing Games. \n\nI admit I am not the best organizer when it comes to my own notes, the most prolific writing medium I had was stacks of small pocket notebooks. I still use them today because they are muscle powered and works as long as I have something to write with. That being said the major setback is when I am trying to pool that information into something more cohesive, it's a mess or spend a very long time in finding it.\n\nNow I have been using this system for a year and I am no master of it but at least I am getting better at organizing my own thoughts as a result of using this system. I share this with you because I want to make a record on my procedures of how I log information and hope you don't have to spend as much time as I did to come to where I am.\n\n## How I approached my vault vs should have\n\nIf I am to advise myself on how I should use the vault to my past self to save me the trouble of trying to change all the files I have in my vault to sync up nicely for searchability and all? Here's the list and I will go over them.\n\n\u003e[!tldr] What I want to advise to my past self, if I could\n\u003e1. Just use it, don't waste time on thinking about the structure at the start.\n\u003e2. Take a weekend to go over the notes and curate them.\n\u003e3. Make a template and structure after reviewing your organizing method.\n\u003e4. Implement the new structure, if you are up for it update the old ones but don't kill yourself.\n\u003e5. Talk to people in the community for insights.\n\n### Just use it.\nI spent quite a bit of my time reading up on different organization methods and plugins. I watched YouTube for organization and notetaking ideas. At the end of the day, those folks on the Internet created all those things because it solves their problem, not mine nor yours. It's a good guide and tool to keep in mind later once you have something to organize. If you already know your organization method, then go right ahead and start structuring your vault. I didn't have any of that and/or didn't know what system or structure I was using till I used it. \n\nThe reason why I recommend you this method is because we are not blank slates, the fact that you can read my writing means you probably have experience in organizing your things your way. If you're like me I never really thought about how I do them, I just did. My old journals and note taking structure varies from book to book as a result of inconsistency or trying a different format. At least at the very start, just use it and record whatever that needs to be recorded. close that note and create another and keep recording. The first step is to use the vault and add some samples into the vault that is actually useful instead of just samples for the same of samples. Your time is precious, don't waste with Lorem Ipsum.\n\n### Take a weekend to review the notes and curate them\nMy friends say I'm scatter brained, I have sudden idea that pops up and I have to say or write them down or read an article title I should read it again. I save them in here and on the weekend I review them. \n\nWhat I learned from revisiting my notes reinforces my memory and able to refine the information. This also gives me a moment to take a breather to restructure them so I can access the information better in the future. If you think something in the notes should be a new note of itself, do that. [I think this is what they call atomic notes?](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/) \n\nThis also provides better understanding of your own note taking styles and able to improve them while you're at it. Another good method is creating a note out of a textbook or an article and see how you reorganize it for better access. How would you note notes on this system? would you use comments by using `%%as comments?%%` or would you put a callout to hide examples as such?\n\n\u003e[!example]-\n\u003eThis is how I put examples so I don't have to read them if I don't want to because it might break the flow of my reading, or keep it open to make example more visible.\n\nI also put TLDR at the top if it's an article I want to summarize in my own words\n\n\u003e[!tldr]\n\u003eYou saw this earlier about what I was going to talk about, well this isn't much of a summary but here it is. You can create callouts by typing `\u003e [!tldr]` for tldr. [You can check out more about Callouts here](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts).\n\n\n#### Make templates and structures\nMy old workplace used to drive me nuts with the folders and document naming conventions, they were using DD-MM-YY so whenever you are trying to sort them or access them it was sorting out by days first. Also no, the system was backed up once a while so created date was no use. So I decided to rename all the files to YYYY-MM-DD and wrote a Standard Operating Procedure.\n\nI recently learned that was a [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) method. I started to use it for my own vault and I added hh-mm so I can create many notes a day. I also automated the file naming by Unique Note Creator from the core modules and pick a template to use.  \n\nSpeaking of templates I can revisit to change them, mostly I have the metadata to record tags and other information. What goes into the metadata varies from file to file depending on its use case. This is what I have for this post.\n\n```\n---\ndate: 2023-02-13\ntitle: How Do You Keep Your Thoughts Organized?\ntags:\n- journaling\n---\n```\n\nIf you are still in the early stages of creating your vault, feel free to experiment and see what format works best for you, maybe you'd rathe put the #journal tag here.\n\nSometimes folder might be your thing. It became a thing for me once I had start having 500 notes. I picked [Johnny Decimal System](https://johnnydecimal.com/)  system and created 10 folders without names and randomly picked 50 as Notes and 00 as Admin. I used Admin to store my template and notes related to managing my obsidian vault. \n\n![[notes/images/johny decimal folder structure.png]]\n\n\u003e It's still work in progress. you can see my Notes is quite big.\n\nIt get easier to identify what these folders should be as you put more stuff in it because you start to see a pattern of things. If you're in school then perhaps one folder should be Courses. There are benefits of using folders such as it is pleasing on the eye and if you are using [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), there's less load for the system when search field is set to a folder instead of the entire vault. Folders also enables you to make sub-vaults, a vault within a vault. I can talk about these two for another time. For now examine your notes and see how you can sort and structure them for ease of access.\n\n#### Implement but don't kill yourself\nThis is actually my second vault because the first I spent all my time on making folders templates and installing whatever plugin from the community I thought I'll need it and ended up not using most of them a few weeks later. This vault's been active for a year and as you can see it's not all sorted, the tags are all over the place and formatting changed on a weekly basis, drawing closer to the current structure. \n\nIf you have an Eureka moment and made a significant changes to how you organize and search your notes and the old notes are not part of the new method? Change the ones you access but don't worry about the rest. You'll get to them eventually.\n\nIt really helped me to review in a timed intervals like weekly or monthly to improve my workflow after reviewing my notes. \n\n#### Talk to people in the community for insights.\nAt first, I just lurked around the [Discord](https://discord.gg/obsidianmd) clicking all the links and reading their posts on the way they decorate their vaults. I don't know when but I started to post on how to deal with certain organization solutions to the methods I had in mind and the community came at me with suggestions like a blood was dropped in the Amazon river full of piranhas. But this is a good kind of frenzy. Now I'm one of the piranhas who bites onto new comer's questions.  \n\n## What I love about Obsidian \nI've used Evernote and Onenote to take notes in the past and the challenge was it had inherent bias in note organization: it couldn't break away from the pocket notebook I used, just digitized.\n\nCall it a gimmick but I love the graph view, especially the local graph view of the note I am working on. This is the first time I've seen a graph view to see all the connections between my notes - including the tags - and see if I can create new connections. also the lack of folder structure initially made it easier for me to not look at my notes like they're not in a notebook. Also you can essentially save a search result by using `query` but you could do so much more and pretty with Dataview which I will cover next time.\n\nI am scatterbrained, my friends say so I keep my own notes whenever I have an idea so  I can refine them later. physical notebook's been an amazing tool for me and I still carry them. However Obsidian really enables me to combine my notes together to create something more than its parts.\n\nI hope you can create something wonderful by combining your ideas together.","lastmodified":"2023-03-16T06:54:20.640112202Z","tags":null},"/notes/journal/Creating-Custom-Monsters-Base-Stats":{"title":"Creating Custom Monsters, Base Stats","content":"\nThanks Azurewren for requesting this:\n\n\u003e [!TLDR]\n\u003e Here's a shorthand for you for now: \n\u003e - take the party's average AC and HP, \n\u003e - take the average total to hit bonus and total damage.\n\u003e - create a monster with AC that would be hit 50% of the time based on their total hit bonus using [Anydice](http://anydice.com/)\n\u003e - set the HP to last about 3 rounds at 50% of DPT\n\u003e - set the monster's to hit to 50% the party's average AC using [Anydice](http://anydice.com/) and deal roughly 1/3 or 1/4 of their HP as damage.\n\u003e - pick 1 good saving throw equal to its +hit, normal saving throw as 1/3 of +hit, rounded down.\n\nNow unto the long part,\n\nThis is designed for mainly 5e but I'm sure the basic procedure is very close enough.\n\nI mostly use homebrew monsters because I want to give my own spin of monster encounters. Also in Dungeons and Dragon's 5e, the challenge rating (CR) doesn't really work and I don't know how it actually calculates the rating. There are many folks out there who wanted to demystify and make a formula of how it worked (mainly, [Paul Hughes' Blog of Holding](https://www.blogofholding.com/?p=7338)). I've taken a lazier method and it was inspired by details addon from World of Warcraft; This way I can always create a challenging encounter based on the party. We used to use this to calculate how long the fight would last or project it and find out who took damage and whatnot. \n\n![](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Details-Damage-Meter-Classic-WoW-Classic-Addon.png)\n\nI've learned the hard way, once I homebrew my campaign, the regular monsters become too weak and the systems they have in place to longer work, it wasn't reliable. It got worse in 5e when the game assumes feats are optional and magic items are scarce. Hence I decided to use the same method as they did in WoW and create monsters based on how long a fight should be for the power level of the player characters.\n\n## Step 1: Analyse the Party \n\n\u003e [!quote] \n\u003e “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” ― \u003ccite\u003e Sun Tzu, The Art of War \u003c/cite\u003e\n\nDespite the quote, I am not designing my encounters to crush my players, nor think of them as my enemy. My goal as a Game Master (GM) is to create conflict that is challenging and engaging for my players to solve and enjoy. With that out of the way, let's get down to the business.\n\nFirst step is to figure out the party's stats and those are:\":\n1. Average HP (AHP) - used to calculate damage output of the creatures.\n2. Average attack bonus (AAB) - used to calculate the creature's AC and saving throw bonuses.\n3. Average AC (AAC) -  used to calculate the to hit value for the creature.\n4. Damage per Turn(DPT) - used to calculate creature's HP.\n\n[Anydice](http://anydice.com/) is our bread and butter to calculate all the theoretical values of our creatures. \n\nDpT can be a bit of a challenge and you can obtain this value from two methods:\n1. Review the combat log of the previous session and tally up all the damage they deal per round. I usually take the average of the 5 rounds. \n2. If you don't track combat logs then you can just look at the character sheets and take the average damage output of their best spells and weapon attacks. The latter method might need a tweaking because the logs would show most of the tactics they deploy (smite, hunter's mark, Sharpshooter/Great Weapon Master Feat). This would be used to calculate the HP of the creature.\n\nI'm going to use  one of the campaign groups, Shadow Talons, as an example here. \n\n\u003e [!example]\n\u003e Shadow Talons is a group of 3 level 4 characters.\n\u003e - AHP: 40\n\u003e - AAB: +7\n\u003e - AAC: 16\n\u003e - DPT: 108\n\n## Step 2: Create Your Creatures\n\nI usually want to keep the combat encounter to no more than 5 rounds else I feel the combat takes too long at times. If you think 5 rounds is short, the consider the following:\n\nIt takes anywhere between 1 to 3 minutes, sometimes even less, per player; this includes decision making, moving their tokens, rolling dice, exchanging confirmations and describing the scene. \n\n\n\u003e [!example]\n\u003e Shadow Talons typically spend about 3 to 10 minutes per round of combat. the bulk of the time is actually me moving the enemies around.\n\nDon't forget you as a GM takes up a bulk of the time especially if you have lots of creatures to manage. \n\nNow with combat duration set up, The next step is to set up the creature's HP that would survive the DPT for about three rounds. This is calculated in combination with the creature's AC. I calculate an input based on the AAB in  [Anydice](http://anydice.com/) and look up where the 50% mark is. \n\nEnsure to click on graph and At least option and find where the graph hits the 50% value, if that is the hit rate you want to aim for. I am using 50% as my benchmark since that's the general design of the Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n\u003e [!example]\n\u003e For Shadow Talons, the solo creature has HP 162 (108 * 3 * 0.5) and AC 18. \n\n\n ![](/content/notes/images/AnyDice20230314205125.png)\n\nThen focus on the offense by calculating the hit rate of the monster to be 50% based on the ACC and damage output as one 1/3 of the AHP.\n\n\u003e [!example]\n\u003e the creature's main attack has +5 to hit and deals 3d6+4(13) damage per strike. \n\nDo fiddle around with the Anydice and get the curve. If you decide to go for multi-attack, consider the following:\n- Single-attack might be slow, but strikes with power.\n- Multi-attack is fast hitting strikes with less power.\n\nThe last part is assigning their saves, there are 6 types of saves with the major three categories are Con, Dex or Wis saves. The easy way for me to assign saves is to pick one as strong and another as decent. This is calculated by putting attack bonus as its strong save and 1/3 rounded down for decent and rest gets no bonus at all.\n\n\u003e [!example]\n\u003e Base Monster Stat\n\u003e - HP: 162\n\u003e - AC: 18\n\u003e - Saves: +5 CON, +1 DEX\n\u003e - Attack: +5 to hit, 3d6+4 damage\n\nThe bare bone structure for the creature is now set. You could roll this out for testing or apply its values to create a creature of your own or slap it into an existing monster from your monster manual.

Then he instructs you to wear the bracelet and when the time table flickers in various colors, open a door with the worn hand to enter the House of Heads. He cautions you to not engage the person you meet in that place and find a head labeled as Baron Von Loid before the time table flickers again in 4 hours to return to this place. \n### Temple Raid\nThe Society of Historical and Archeological Relic Treasury (SHART) excavates ruins and collects relics of the past to inform the public about the rich history of their lands.

You have worked with this dwarf in the past, quirky but he pays well. This time he paid one third in advance to sweeten the deal and when you asked what's in the cargo, he simply replies, \"Pies.\".

However it breaks the immersion for me to think the dungeon is a safe place for you to rest for 8 hours and the master of the dungeon or lair is going to let the intruder to set up a camp and rest. Of course you as the Dungeon Master can simply not let them rest because there are monster roaming in the dungeon/lair to interrupt their long rest and stopping them from taking that sweet sleep or there is a time limit before their mission fails forcing them to press on.\n\nThat solved the sleeping in the dungeon part but there's still another issue, the lack of down time. \n\nThen let's stretch some time.\n\nIn the Dungeon Master's Guide page 267 there is a Rest Variants section; epic heroic or gritty realism. The gritty realism alters the short rest to 8 hours and long rest to 7 days. This fundamentally changes the dynamics of the game completely in more ways than one. unfortunately the DMG does not describe how it exactly alters the resting mechanics, such as what is allowed to be done during the rest time. What would constitute a light activity versus heavy activity? Does this mean if you accidently walk for 1 hour would reset my long rest timer?\n\nThe DMG talks about it's a good option to emphsize intruge, politics and interacitons among other NPCs. Unless you are doing dungeon crawl, in fact I think it is essential to have all those activities to make your game more immersive. Spending time to collect information to plan ahead about the adventure ahead takes time, they can't google to look things up or amazon to have their immovable rods delievered at their doorstep the next day. They need to hit the dusty tomes in the wizard's tower and procure materials to make the right tools for the adventure from the right crafter.  Here's an addon to this gritty realism varient rest system.\n\n## It's a Reset Monday\n\nIf you ever played any MMOs, there's a server reset on a weekly basis, it's the same thing, the long rest reset is on Monday. The session always starts on Monday, unless it is a continueation from the last session, and the session happens in a span of a week. If the session is to have the to go to a dungeon then it would make the party to be more careful on picking fights and they will be more tactical rather than fireball first and ask questions later. they know they cannot rely on a long rest to refresh their abilities and they know there's a big boss at the end and have to manage their resources more carefully. \n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-16T06:54:20.640112202Z","tags":null},"/private/Journal-Drafts/Character-Development-Diary-01-Tools":{"title":"Character Development Diary 01","content":"\n\nI love creating characters for my table top roleplaying games (TTRPG) and there are many ways of creating characters from looking up artworks on the Internet to random creation from places like [donjon](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/random/#type=npc). \n\nI personally like to craft my non-player character (NPC) that are part of the plot with more care than a click of a button. \n![Color Pie](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/mtgsalvation_gamepedia/images/e/e1/Color_Wheel.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20060415063339)\n\n\n[Dicetry's Definitive Color Pie Collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkXfTPpkEx4\u0026t=89s\u0026ab_channel=DiceTry) sums it up in a hour long video of all the colors and what they represent\n\nhttps://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/its-not-easy-being-green-revisited-2015-08-10\n\nhttps://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/seeing-red-revisited-2015-08-03\n\nhttps://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/great-white-way-revisited-2015-07-13\n\nhttps://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/black-revisited-2015-07-27\n\nhttps://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/true-blue-revisited-2015-07-20","lastmodified":"2023-03-16T06:54:20.640112202Z","tags":null},"/private/Journal-Drafts/Test-Journal-Entry":{"title":"Test Journal Entry","content":"\nI haven't touched this in a while so I am going to test how this would work with whether [[private/Howling in the Night]] with [[notes/ttrpg/OMG One Shot Campaign Selection and Outline|OMG 1Shot]] links are working.\n\n[[Skeleton in My Closet|Skeletons in My Closet]]","lastmodified":"2023-03-16T06:54:20.640112202Z","tags":null}}
