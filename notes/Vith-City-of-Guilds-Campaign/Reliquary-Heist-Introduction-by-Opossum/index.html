I wasn&rsquo;t expecting them to have that many guards. They doubled the security since the last time and I&mldr; we got you out&mldr; no hard feelings right? This time I have something easier. We&rsquo;re probably prying something off from the dead instead of the living. Our client wants to remain annoy&mldr; annoying&mldr; anonymus! My guess is they are one of the big twelve guilds else why they want to mess with the biggest security guild?</p><p><a href=/ttrpg/notes/20220922164036 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/ttrpg/notes/20220922164036>Members List</a></p><p>Let&rsquo;s cut to the cheese, stuff our client want is four clear crystals in a strongbox 137 in Iron Hound&rsquo;s Reliquary. yup, those mean dwarven black bastards keep their dead kin in their own crypt. But what are they but just another greedy dwarves? once I did a little sniffing around, there&rsquo;s quite a security, I think we have something here my fellow Catchers. They have two guards on a 4 hour rotation and a designated candle keeper basically lives in the tomb. They do take in visitors, I&rsquo;ve only seen dwarves no less, but I couldn&rsquo;t observe any further as a human scurrying around the dwarven district sticks out like a rat in a granary.</p><p>Our client has given us a rough detail of what is to be expected; guards, traps and a safe to crack. Also this chest with some helpful tools.</p><blockquote><p>[!info]- Chest</p><ul><li><p>A poem</p><p>A Bulwark with two shields,</p><p>A Cleric with seven fingers,</p><p>A captain with a trident,</p><p>And a Scout with no arrows,</p><p>Together, they&rsquo;ve fought, laughed and laid here.</p></li><li><p>Vial of Acid, 4</p></li><li><p>A key with 137 written on it</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Remember this is a guarded tomb, so I bet there&rsquo;s something shiny down there and those crafty dwarves would have made machinations to prevent good folks like us. Be careful of their tiled floor tiles and weird holes on the wall. Or maybe they have something to prevent the Candle Keeper to not trigger any of them.</p><p>Our client never mentioned about not stealing anything else so whatever you grab from that place is yours, make sure to swipe some extra for me.</p><p>They&rsquo;re lean and mean thugs my fellow Ratcatchers and going against them with your fangs out is a suicide. They&rsquo;re not, fortune smiles upon us, the brightest dwarves in the city. You should be able to outsmart them the Ratcatcher; hoodwink and disappear. So if you need anything, you can always ask our quartermaster for the tools you would need to get this done.</p><hr><h2 id=available-items>Available items:</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Cost (GP)</th><th>Weight (lb)</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alchemist Fire</td><td>50</td><td>0.1</td><td>This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air.
